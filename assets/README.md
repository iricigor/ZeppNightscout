# Assets Directory

This directory contains app resources:

- **icon.png**: App icon (recommended size: 192x192px)
- **images/**: Additional images used in the app
- **fonts/**: Custom fonts if needed

## Icon

Place your app icon as `icon.png` in this directory. The icon should:
- Be 192x192 pixels
- Be in PNG format
- Represent the Nightscout app (e.g., glucose meter, chart icon)

For now, this is a placeholder. Add your actual icon file here.
